# Patched "DejaVu Sans Mono" fonts for IDEA + MacType 

For all those who love (like me) Mac font rendering and enjoy syntactic *eye candy* when it comes to code, **DejaVu Sans Mono** has been one of the very few fonts that performed well on Jetbrains IDEA products while using MacType. However, there are some minor issues disturbing slightly the whole experience for users who seek higher font sizes.


This is a custom version of DejaVu Sans Mono with some glyphs patched, specially adapted to work well on the *12-14px* settings of IDEA products.
